# SpinnyGun

This will be an arcade game that features a spinny gun at the bottom of the screen that rotates left and right without input from the player.

The player must hit the space bar to fire the weapon when a shot is lined up with an enemy approaching from the top of the screen

If an enemy gets to the bottom of the screen, the player loses health.

Other theming, branding, and story elements are TBD. This project is to learn how to make games.
